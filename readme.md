### Rules of the game:

##### Lessons:
During the semester each group will have 2 lessons of C++: 1 lecture and 1 seminar. Course roadmap is [here](https://github.com/Costello1329/cpp-interns-2020/blob/master/_info/roadmap.md).

##### Homeworks:
You'll also have 5 homework tasks during the semester. All homeworks cost 60 points. It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again â€“ it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also need to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

##### Deadlines:
Each deadline will be stated in the correspoding readme.md file of the task. Every solution must be sent for the first time strictly before the deadline! It's absolutely necessary to send the working code that passes every test. Non-working solution wouldn't be considered as the appropriate solution of the task. You'll have some time to fix troubles with the codestyle and logic (if your programm will contain them) after passing the first check.

##### Exam:
On the last lesson (January 13-th I think) I will conduct an online examination: you'll have to complete an online test. Exam costs 40 points.

##### Final mark:
Your final mark can be calculated with this formula: `if x >= 30 then round(x / 10) else retake()` where x is your semester score.
